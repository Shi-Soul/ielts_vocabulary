# There are some materials used and collected during preparation for ielts.
## listening
### a collection of vocabulary of "王陆语料库".

### CONTENT:
- `ref`: This folder contains the original text files of the corpus.
- `test`: This folder is where I write down when listning to the audio files.
- `err`: This folder contains error books. Generated by `ErrorBookGenerate.py` for latest commit. 
  
### USAGE:
Wirte down what you listen to in the `test` folder, and then use `diff` or any other diff-tools(like `git diff`/`diff` in vscode).

### Oracle:
`https://space.bilibili.com/245086940` Most bilibili videos are copies of this uploader's work. But lacks for chapter 8(chapter about "number", like phone numbers).

### mumbles
7.14 I 've found there are so many error refering meanings, and lots of words are just rarely met.

7.12 It's no use to care about English or American spelling. After all I need to convert my code to AE, or just wait for some colleagues to figure it out.
