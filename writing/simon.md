# Task 1
## line graph
![line graph](Simon's%20writing/line-graph.png)
- The line graph compares the **amount of electricity produced** in France using four different **sources of/provided/generated** power **over a period of** 32 years.
- Is is clear that nuclear power was **by far the most important** **means of electricity generation** **over the period shown**. Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.
- In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a **negligible amount**. Just one year later, **nuclear power overtook thermal power** **as the primary source of electricity**.
> 关注开始阶段
- Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from nuclear power **rose dramatically to a peak of** 430 terawatt hours. **By contrast**, **the figure for** thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and **remained at this level/remained stable** for the rest of the period. Hydroelectric power generation remained relatively stable, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period, but renewable electricity production **saw only a small rise** to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.

## bar chart

- The bar chart compares the number of mobile phones **sold worldwide** by the five **most popular** manufacturers in the years 2009, 2011 and 2013. 
- It is clear that Nokia sold the most mobile phones between 2009 and 2011, but Samsung became the **best selling brand** in 2013. Samsung and Apple **saw the biggest rises** in sales over the 5-year period.
- In 2009, Nokia sold **close to** 450 million **mobile phones/handsets/units**, which was **almost** **double the number** of handsets sold by **the second most successful manufacturer**, Samsung. Over the following four years, however, Nokia's **sales figures** fell by **approximately** 200 million units, whereas Samsung saw sales **rise by a similar amount**. By 2013, Samsung had become the **market leader** with sales reaching 450 million units.

- The other three **top selling** mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013 were LG, ZTE and Apple. In 2009, these companies sold **around** 125 million, 50 million and 25 million mobile handsets **respectively**, but Apple **overtook** the other two **vendors/brands/manufacturers/companies** in 2011. In 2013, **purchases** of Apple handsets reached 150 million units, while LG **saw declining sales** and the figures for ZTE rose only slightly.

## pie chart
![pie chart](Simon's%20writing/pie-chart.png)
- The pie charts compare five categories of household **expenditure/spending/spent/costs** in the UK and New Zealand in the years 1980 and 2008.
- It is noticeable that the **proportion of spending** on food and drink **fell** in both countries over the 28-year period, while spending on utility bills **rose/saw an increase in**. Also, Uk residents **spent a significanly larger** **percentage of their household budgets** on leisure **than their New Zealand counterparts**.
> 2 similarities and 1 big difference
- In 1980, 29% of an average New Zealand household budget went on food and drink, **while** **the equivalent figure for a UK home** was 23%. **By 2008**, expenditure on food and drink **had fallen** by 4% in New Zealand, and by a full 10% in the UK. **By contrast/while**, both countries saw an increase in expenditure on utility bills for the average home, from 27% to 31% in New Zealand and from 26% to 28% in the UK.
> 更细化的介绍similarity。 用数字
- **Leisure activities accounted for the highest proportion** of UK household spending in both years, but only the third highest proportion in New Zealand. In fact, in 2008, New Zealanders **spent only half as much in relative terms on** **recreation/leisure**(17%) as UK residents(34%). In both countires, transport costs and other costs took roughly 10% of household budgets respectively.
