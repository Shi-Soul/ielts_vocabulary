Graph Information:
Title: Percentage of population living in cities in four Asian countries
|             | 1970 | 1980 | 1990 | 2000 | 2010 | 2020 | 2030 | 2040 |
|-------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|

| Indonesia   | 14   | 15   | 23   | 29   | 44   | 52   | 60   | 63   |

### My Answer:
The line chart gives information about the proportion of population living in cities in four Asian coutries , Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, from 1970 to 2020, with prediction for 2030 and 2040. The first main feature is that the population of all countries keep growing continuously, except for Philippines with a loss during 1990 to 2010. 
Another information to be noticed is that the percentage of the population living in cities of Malaysia is always larger than other countries, followed by Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand.  Percentage of Indonesia, which was the lowest of four countries at the begining of 1970, grew to the second largest after 2010. The percentage of citizens in Philippines was the largest in 1970, but ranked third after 2010.
What is more, the citizen population is estimated to get larger for 2030 and 2040 for all countries. Thailand, with smallest percentage, is predicted to grow steeper than other countries. Malaysia and Indonesia, with comparably larger proportion, will grow slower.

### Description:
The most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your ownknowledge or experience.
### My Answer:
The most important aim of science is always attracting, for it tells why scientist work and what they should do. Although Some people believe that the most critical aim of science should be to improve people's lives, I would agree with those who set curiosity as the first aim.
It is significant that science should be to promote people's living condition. Human has the initial ambition to live a better life, and therefore they research for how to do so. For example, Shennong tasted a hundred kinds of herbs to tell which could be used as medicine and which were toxic. In today's world, scientists take the advantage of super computer to calculate the structure of medicine that could cure diseases which was sorted as undefeatable. However, these kind of new technologies are all spins-off from high-end scientific work, which are initially used for other functions and converted to improving people's lives gradually by other creators.
On the other hand, I would argue that curiosity is one of the most important aim of science.  It is that someone wants to know at first and then someone implements or find it.  APARNET was the first net service used to communicate for American militaries and universities. It gradually grew to Internet and people almost cannot live without it nowadays, from chatting, shopping, booking to anything. Nevertheless, it was a idea of a scientists that if  APARNET could use a better file management. He implemented it as Hyper Text Manangement Language, and it finally got explosively popular.
In conclusion, It is my view that the most vital aim of science should not just be to improve people's lives. We need to stay curious and more things to push science higher and higher, which will benefit people's lives as the side effect.
