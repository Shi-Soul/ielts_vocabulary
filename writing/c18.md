### My Answer:
The line chart gives information about the proportion of population living in cities in four Asian coutries , Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, from 1970 to 2020, with prediction for 2030 and 2040. The first main feature is that the population of all countries keep growing continuously, except for Philippines with a loss during 1990 to 2010. <br>
Another information to be noticed is that the percentage of the population living in cities of Malaysia is always larger than other countries, followed by Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand.  Percentage of Indonesia, which was the lowest of four countries at the begining of 1970, grew to the second largest after 2010. The percentage of citizens in Philippines was the largest in 1970, but ranked third after 2010.<br>
What is more, the citizen population is estimated to get larger for 2030 and 2040 for all countries. Thailand, with smallest percentage, is predicted to grow steeper than other countries. Malaysia and Indonesia, with comparably larger proportion, will grow slower.

The line chart gives information about the proportion of population living in cities in four Asian countries, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia, from 1970 to 2020, with predictions for 2030 and 2040. The first main feature is that the population of all countries keeps growing continuously, except for the Philippines with a **decline** during 1990 to 2010.<br>
Another **piece of information** to be noticed is that the percentage of the population living in cities of Malaysia is always larger than in other countries, followed by the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. The percentage of Indonesia, which was the lowest of the four countries at the **beginning** of 1970, grew to the second largest after 2010. The percentage of citizens in the Philippines was the largest in 1970 but ranked third after 2010.<br>
**Furthermore**, the citizen population is estimated to **increase** for 2030 and 2040 for all countries. Thailand, with the smallest percentage, is predicted to grow more rapidly than other countries. Malaysia and Indonesia, with **comparatively** larger proportion, will grow more slowly.

The provided line chart illustrates the progression of urbanization in four Asian countries—namely, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia—spanning the years from 1970 to 2020, and offering projections for 2030 and 2040. **Several prominent trends emerge from the data, showcasing distinct patterns in urban population growth and development.**<br>
A salient observation is the continuous urban population increase across all four countries, except for a downturn in the Philippines during the 1990s to 2010. This decline in the Philippines, however, is overshadowed by the consistent upward trajectory in the other countries, reinforcing the overall trend of urban expansion.<br>
Of noteworthy significance is the consistently higher proportion of urban population in Malaysia, surpassing other nations throughout the timeline. Following this, the Philippines and Indonesia share a relatively similar urbanization pattern, with Indonesia experiencing a remarkable shift from the lowest urbanization rate in 1970 to a substantial surge post-2010. Interestingly, the Philippines, which held the highest urban population in 1970, **transitioned** to the third position by 2010.<br>
Projections suggest that urban populations are set to expand for all four countries by 2030 and 2040. Remarkably, Thailand, despite its initially **modest** urban population, is predicted to experience the most rapid growth, **surpassing its counterparts**. Meanwhile, Malaysia and Indonesia, with larger existing urban populations, are expected to undergo a **gradual expansion**.<br>
**In conclusion**, the data highlights the prevailing trend of urbanization in the **studied Asian countries**. The analysis reveals significant variations in the pace of growth, and while the Philippines experienced a temporary decline, the other countries exhibited consistent upward trends in urban population.

### Description:
The most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your ownknowledge or experience.
### My Answer:
The most important aim of science is always attracting, for it tells why scientist work and what they should do. Although Some people believe that the most critical aim of science should be to improve people's lives, I would agree with those who set curiosity as the first aim.<br>
It is significant that science should be to promote people's living condition. Human has the initial ambition to live a better life, and therefore they research for how to do so. For example, Shennong tasted a hundred kinds of herbs to tell which could be used as medicine and which were toxic. In today's world, scientists take the advantage of super computer to calculate the structure of medicine that could cure diseases which was sorted as undefeatable. However, these kind of new technologies are all spins-off from high-end scientific work, which are initially used for other functions and converted to improving people's lives gradually by other creators.<br>
On the other hand, I would argue that curiosity is one of the most important aim of science.  It is that someone wants to know at first and then someone implements or find it.  APARNET was the first net service used to communicate for American militaries and universities. It gradually grew to Internet and people almost cannot live without it nowadays, from chatting, shopping, booking to anything. Nevertheless, it was a idea of a scientists that if  APARNET could use a better file management. He implemented it as Hyper Text Manangement Language, and it finally got explosively popular.<br>
In conclusion, It is my view that the most vital aim of science should not just be to improve people's lives. We need to stay curious and more things to push science higher and higher, which will benefit people's lives as the side effect.

### gpt's revised answer:
rank 7<br>
The **primary** aim of science is a subject **of enduring fascination**, as it elucidates the motivations behind scientists' endeavors and their ultimate objectives. While some argue that science's pivotal goal should be enhancing human lives, I am inclined to align with those who emphasize the significance of curiosity as the driving force behind scientific pursuits.<br>
Undoubtedly, science holds the potential to ameliorate the quality of human existence. The inherent human desire for better living conditions has historically propelled research and innovation. An illustrative example is that of Shennong, who meticulously sampled numerous herbs to distinguish medicinal from toxic varieties. In contemporary times, cutting-edge technologies, such as supercomputing, have facilitated the discovery of groundbreaking medicines that were once deemed insurmountable challenges. Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that these advancements often stem from fundamental scientific exploration, repurposed over time to benefit society.<br>
On the contrary, I contend that nurturing curiosity ranks among the paramount aims of science. This insatiable yearning to understand and explore drives both discovery and implementation. Take the case of ARPANET, initially a communication tool for American military and academic institutions, which has evolved into the indispensable Internet we rely on today for activities ranging from communication to commerce. Remarkably, the transition was spurred by a scientist's vision for enhanced file management, which was realized through the creation of the Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), leading to an exponential surge in usage.<br>
In conclusion, my perspective aligns with the notion that science's principal aim should transcend the mere improvement of human lives. Embracing curiosity and nurturing the quest for knowledge are equally pivotal. By continuing to cultivate our innate thirst for understanding, we inadvertently propel science to new heights, yielding benefits for society as an incidental outcome.
